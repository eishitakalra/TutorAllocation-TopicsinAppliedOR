The files in this document are the following:

1. NewData.txt : The new input data for the initial mosel model and the second python model
2. Tutor_Allocation.mos : The mosel file which contains the initial allocation problem that optimises fairness and preferences subject to constraints
3. Second_model_tutor_dropout : The python notebook which contains the second part of the model that can alter allocations without re running the whole problem

The following are the csv files of the output from the initial mosel file used in the second model
4. each_tutors_hours.csv : The number of hours worked by each tutor
5. tutor_assignments.csv : The tutors assigned to courses at each timeslot t
6. updated_availibility.csv : The updated matrix which is 1 if the tutor is availible at timeslot t and 0 otherwise, based on allocation from initial model

7. Tradeoff Calculation Outputs : A file containing the outputs from the different objective functions of different P1 and P2 values
In the format each_tutor_hours_P1_{i}_P2_{j}.csv , where i is P1 = weight on preference value and j is P2 = weight on fairness value

The following are the files of the data cleaning and synthesis process
